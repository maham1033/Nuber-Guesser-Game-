# Number Guesser Game 
# Project Overview
The Number Guesser game is a simple guessing game built in Java using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. The game works by generating a random number between a user-specified range and prompting the player to guess the number. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number, with feedback provided after each guess to help them narrow down their choices.
The Number Guesser game is designed to be simple and easy to play, with a clear and intuitive user interface that makes it accessible to users of all levels of experience. It is a fun way to pass the time and test your guessing skills, and it can also be used as a teaching tool to help students learn about random number generation, conditional statements, and other key programming concepts.
